üîä Task 2: Speech to Text System ‚Äì Project Description (500 words)

Speech recognition is one of the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence in recent years. In Task 2 of this internship, we developed a Speech to Text System using Python, which captures spoken audio through the microphone and converts it into readable text format. This task bridges the gap between human communication and digital interpretation, demonstrating the real-world utility of AI in day-to-day life.
The core objective of this project is to build a system that can listen to a user‚Äôs voice input, process it in real-time, and display the exact spoken words as text. This process is known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It is widely used in virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, and also in accessibility technologies such as dictation tools and closed captioning systems.
The project was implemented using Python with two essential libraries: SpeechRecognition and PyAudio. The SpeechRecognition library provides easy access to several speech recognition engines, including Google‚Äôs Web Speech API, which was used in this task. The PyAudio library was used to access the system microphone and stream audio data to the recognizer.
The process begins with initializing a recognizer object from the speech_recognition module. The program then uses the system microphone to capture live audio. As soon as the user speaks, the audio is recorded, and the recognizer processes the data using the Google Web Speech API. Once the speech is analyzed, it is converted into human-readable text and displayed on the screen. The program includes basic error handling to manage situations where the audio cannot be understood or if the API service is unavailable.
This task helps demonstrate several real-time AI concepts such as audio preprocessing, real-time data handling, and interaction with cloud-based services. From a user perspective, it feels like speaking to a smart assistant. From a technical viewpoint, this simple interface hides complex processes involving digital signal processing (DSP), acoustic modeling, and natural language interpretation.
The UI output for this task can be designed in a clean and minimalistic style, showing components like a microphone icon, a prompt to start speaking, and a card displaying the converted text. An example output could be:

üé§ You said: ‚ÄúThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.‚Äù

This task not only builds technical skills but also demonstrates how human-computer interaction can be made smoother and more natural through voice. It emphasizes the importance of designing user-friendly AI systems that can understand human input seamlessly. The project can be further enhanced by adding features like multi-language support, voice command execution, or saving the transcript for future use.
In conclusion, this task gives a strong foundation in applying artificial intelligence to real-world applications. By converting speech to text, we open doors to countless possibilities in accessibility, automation, and interactive systems. It marks a significant step in developing smarter, more intuitive applications powered by AI.
